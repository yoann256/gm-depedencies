# Security Policy
As a open-contribution project, we don't have any code reviewer except the following:
- @yoann256 (Human, Owner of the repository)
- Copilot AI (Robot)
- CodeQL (Workflow)
- Secret scanning (Scanner)

## Reporting a vulnerability
To report a vulnerability, either open **an issue**, or send an email to [yoanndegardin03@gmail.com](mailto:yoanndegardin03@gmail.com).\
The best way of these two is to open an issue, as the repository is public and my email inbox is private.
